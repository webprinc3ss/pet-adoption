                            Hi! I am Eevee, a sweet and gentle chihuahua! Until I was 11 years old, I was owned by a breeder
                            who did not care enough about my health. When I was found by a pet rescue organization, I had no
                            teeth and my leg was so injured, it had to be removed. I learned to get around on three legs, though,
                            and I still had a heart of gold. <br /><br />

                            When my new mom Ellie adopted me, I was really nervous at first... when I saw how caring she was, I felt
                            comfortable showing her my silly side! I am so lucky that I got a second chance at the magical life I deserved!
                            <br /><br />

                            Now, I am an ambassador for MustFit Pets. This is my story and why I want to help other hard-to-place-pets
                            find a furever home.  Thank you.
                        </p>
                    </section>
                </Grid.Column>
